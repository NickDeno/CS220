Signals:
    -Used by OS communicate with the process
    -If you want to do something for specific signal, you need to create 
     signal holder
    -Creating handler:
     void handler(int signum){
        if(signum == SIGNAL){
            #DO SOMETHING
        }
        #Set the signal handler to a specific signal
        signal(SIGNAL, handler);
     }

Setjmp:
    -Takes snapshot of program state
    -State specific registers: Instruction pointer(rip), stack pointer(rsp)
     general purpose registers(rax,rbx,rcx,rdx,rsi,rdi,r8-r15)
    -Does not store the state of heap(malloc, etc)
    -Stores in jmp_buf
    -Returns 0 on success

Longjmp:
    -Restores snapshot and continue from setjmp. as if setjmp returned 
     non-zero value
Zero Byte Array:
    -An array that is initialized with zero bytes
    -Are placeholder where space is not allocated
    Programmers will allocate space at runtime
